There are two files here with "timeofsampling" in the name. Their purpose is to print out the timestamp for the casts so that the time can be manually merged into the final metadata file.

We chose to rename them this way so that it was clear these files are not to be used for the final output for general consumption but were simply an intermediate we used (Yubin and Jesse).
