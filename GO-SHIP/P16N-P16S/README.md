## Important notes for posterity

Relative to DNA IDs written on tubes from Carlson lab, Yubin Raut and Jesse McNichol have determined on 2022-11-07 by comparing the vertical profile of [DNA] with water column features such as chlorophyll / beam attenuation that the following DNA IDs need to be corrected to match up with the CLIVAR CTD data:
- P16S-S47-N14 and P16S-S47-N08 are *reversed*
- The tube labelled P16S-S47-N15 is in fact, P16-S47-N05. This is most likely a typo.

Based on the previous case, the targeted CTD pressures (we know they are targets, not real pressure because they are round numbers) match better with a different Niskin ID than what was recorded as the DNA ID. Therefore, we trust the targeted CTD pressure. According to this logic:
- The DNA ID provided by the Carlson Lab (P16S-S84-N27) more closely matches the CTD pressure of P16S-S84-N26, so therefore P16S-S84-N27 should be changed to P16S-S84-N26 to match the CTD cast data.
- P16S-S84-N26 more closely matches the CTD pressure of P16S-S84-N25, so by the same logic P16S-S84-N26 should be changed to P16S-S84-N25.
- P16S-S84-N24 more closely matches the CTD pressure of P16S-S84-N23, so by the same logic P16S-S84-N24 should be chan
ged to P16S-S84-N23.
- P16S-S84-N22 more closely matches the CTD pressure of P16S-S84-N21, so by the same logic P16S-S84-N22 should be chan
ged to P16S-S84-N21.
- P16S-S84-N20 more closely matches the CTD pressure of P16S-S84-N19, so by the same logic P16S-S84-N20 should be chan
ged to P16S-S84-N19.

*Another reason wny this is likely correct is that for P16S-S84, the mismatch could be explained by the transposition of a single row.*

*These DNA ids have been corrected in the final, uploaded sequence files and CMAP uploads. However, the original DNA tubes and some of the intermediate files (e.g. PCR plate setups or demultiplexing info) will have these old, incorrect DNA IDs.*
