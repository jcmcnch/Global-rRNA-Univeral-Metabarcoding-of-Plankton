## Important notes for posterity

Relative to DNA IDs written on tubes from Carlson lab, Yubin Raut and Jesse McNichol have determined on 2022-11-07 by comparing the vertical profile of [DNA] with water column features such as chlorophyll / beam attenuation that the following DNA IDs need to be corrected to match up with the CLIVAR CTD data:
- P16S-S47-N14 and P16S-S47-N08 are *reversed*
- The tube labelled P16S-S47-N15 is in fact, P16-S47-N05. This is most likely a typo.

*These DNA ids have been corrected in the final, uploaded sequence files and CMAP uploads. However, the original DNA tubes and some of the intermediate files (e.g. PCR plate setups or demultiplexing info) will have these old, incorrect DNA IDs.
